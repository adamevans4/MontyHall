You are on a game show with 3 doors in front of you.
One door has a prize, the others are empty.
You choose a door. The host opens a door.
THIS DOOR IS NOT THE ONE YOU PICKED, AND IS 
ALWAYS EMPTY.

You are then allowed to either switch your 
choice to the other door, or keep your choice
with the current door.

Should you swap your answer?
OR
Should you stay on the same door?

download/clone this repo and run in your terminal.
You may need to do CHMOD +x gameshow.py to run in temrinal.
Command format is as follows: ./gameshow.py <Number of Rounds>
i.e. ./gameshow.py 100
Output is as follows: 
=== Rounds: 100 ===
Wins if Stay: xx (Rate: 0.xx)
Wins if Swap: xx (Rate: 0.xx)

Future plans: I'll update this in the future to where you are actually playing the game, rather than a simple math problem simulation. (maybe a UI instead of text commands...)
