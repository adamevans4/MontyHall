You are on a game show with 3 doors in front of you.
One door has a prize, the others are empty.
You choose a door. The host opens a door.
THIS DOOR IS NOT THE ONE YOU PICKED, AND IS 
ALWAYS EMPTY.

You are then allowed to either switch your 
choice to the other door, or keep your choice
with the current door.

Should you swap your answer?
OR
Should you stay on the same door?
